# Bookseeker
## [Description](#table-of-content)
A book search engine for book lovers.
The purpose of this project is to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
